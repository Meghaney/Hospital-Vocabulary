Hospital Vocabulary <b> مفردات المستشفى </b> book has more than 600 English-Arabic medical words. The book is the output of an idea that came to my mind when my youngest daughter after completing her B.ScN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) and five years work experience as registered nurse, got her first foreign job in an Arabic speaking country.

Hospital Vocabulary book is primarily for those non-Arabic speaking medical staff of hospitals and clinics working or employed in Arabic speaking countries and need to understand common medical words in Arabic to converse with their local patients who cannot speak English and try to convey their health conditions in Arabic language only. Also the book will be equally useful for local as well as overseas medical students studying in Arabic speaking countries.

The book provides common medical words in English and Arabic. English words are sorted alphabetically. Few common grammar abbreviations are used throughout the book. Abbreviations page is provided among the first few pages of the book.  Transliteration of each Arabic word is given in Englsih letters with due care in its formation making it easy to pronounce for the readers. Repetition of transliteration is abbreviated as tilde "~".
